1. 强调句型

   1. 构成：It is … that/who …

      that可以指人，也可以指物，但是who只能指人。

      I met my old flame in the street yesterday.

      It <u>was I</u> that met my old flame in the street yesterday.

      It <u>was yesterday</u> that I met my old flame in the street.

      当强调句型It is … that …在句子中出现的时候，它们是不作成分的，本身也没有任何意义。需要注意的是，强调部分不允许有任何的修改，并且一般情况下，强调句型不能强调句子的谓语成分。

   2. 强调句型和主语从句的区别

      判断方法在于，只需要将It is … that …去掉即可。如果去掉之后，句子的成分依然完整的话，就是强调句；如果去掉之后，句子成分残缺，就是主语从句。

      It is obvious that one should make friends with those who can make you aggressive and optimistic.（主语从句）

2. 应用

   1. 写作

      It is to account for the phenomenon that there exist numerous factors here.

      As was discussed before,it was not until the 19th century that the newspaper became the dominant pre-electronic（电子时代以前的） medium,following <u>in the wake of</u> （随着…的到来）the pamphlet and the book and <u>in the company of</u>（和…一起） the <u>periodical</u>（期刊、杂志）.

      * 长难句分析

        首先需要会识别倒装句：一般疑问句的语序，但后面没有问号。

        其次需要正确翻译：倒装不能直接翻译。

        Television is one of the means by which these feelings are created and conveyed——and perhaps never before has it served so much to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe.

        Only gradually was the by-product（副产品） of the institution noted,and only more gradually still was the effect considered as a directive factor <u>in the conduct of</u>（在…的行为中） the institution.

        <u>Coupled with</u>（与…结合） the growing quantity of information is the development of the technologies which enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations than has ever been possible before.
   
4. 虚拟语气

      1. 什么是虚拟语气

         当表示与事实相反的或虚假的、难以实现的情况时用虚拟语气。有时表示主观愿望，建议或某种强烈情感时，也用虚拟语气。

      2. 一般用法

         If you are a tear in my eyes,I will never shed it.

         If you were a tear in my eyes,I would never shed it.（虚拟语气）

         

         If I was a dog last night,I could sleep beside you.

         If I had been a dog last night,I could have slept beside you.（虚拟语气）

      3. 总结

         * 对现在和将来的虚拟

           主句用“would + do”；从句用一般过去时

         * 对过去的虚拟

           主句用“could + have done”；从句用过去完成时

           需要注意的是，第一，在虚拟语气中，am/is/are的过去时都是were，不用was；第二，would=could=might。
         
           If most of youngsters fail to be confident,the whole society will pay a heavy price.
         
           If most of youngsters failed to be confident,the whole society would pay a heavy price.（虚拟）

           If every university student indulged in surfing on the Internet,it would be hard for them to graduate smoothly.（虚拟）

   3. 特殊用法

      1. 以下情况从句用“should + 动词原形”表示虚拟，并且should可以省略：

         * 以防：in case that、for fear that、lest等。
         * 命令：order、direct、command等。
         * 建议：suggest、advise、propose等。
         * 要求：ask、request、require、demand等。

         It is neccessary/important/urgent that …（用虚拟语气）

         My boyfriend asked me that I should lose my weight as quickly as possible.

         It is neccessary that universities should take urgent steps to attach importance to the issue of mental health of university students.

      2. 以下情况用过去时表示虚拟

         常见的两个：would rather和it is high time that …

         I would rather you were happier than I.

         It is high time that we poured attention into the issue and took neccessary actions.

      3. 以下情况要区别对待

         常见的词有：wish、if noly（如果…该有多好啊）、but for（要不是）、or/otherwise（否则）、as if/as though（好像）等。

         区别对待的意思是，把本来的时态变成相应的过去时，情况类似于if条件语句变虚拟语气。

         I wish I will be your angel and protect you.

         I wish I would be your angel and protect you.（虚拟）

         When I was young,he treated me as if I was his own son.

         When I was young,he treated me as if I has been his own son.（虚拟）

      4. 虚拟语气的倒装

         if引导虚拟条件句时，如果从句中有were/had/should，可以省略if，用倒装句式“were/had/should + 主语”。

         If I were at school again,I would study better.

         Were I at school again,I would study better.（倒装）

      5. 应用

         长难句分析：无论句子有没有使用虚拟语气，都可以直接翻译

         If it did,it would open up its diversity（多样性，差异） program,now focused narrowly on race（种族） and gender（性别）,and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook（世界观）,values,education,and class.

         

         If that happened,passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott（联合抵制） products putting the reputation of the target company at risk.

         

         The millions of calculations involved,had they been done by hand,would have lost all practical value by the time they were finished.

5. 插入语

   1. 含义

      插入语是指插在句子中的词语或句子，其位置比较灵活，通常是逗号或者破折号隔开，与句子的其他部分之间没有语法上的关系。其作用是对一句话附加解释，说明或总结；有时表示说话人的态度和看法；有时起强调作用；有时是为了引起对方的注意，还可以起转移话题或说明原因的作用；也可以起承上启下，使语句间的衔接更加紧密。

   2. 常用插入语

      1. 副词作插入语

         undoubtedly、indeed、surely、obviously、briefly、actually、furthermore、besides、additionally、similarity、exactly等。

         Respecting parents,undoubtedly,keeps a Chinese traditional virtue.

         Cooperation,actually,is a neccessity to success.

      2. 介词短语作插入语

         for my part，from my perspective,in short,on the contrary,in other words,in a /some sense,in general,in one's position,in conclusion,in reality,as a matter of fact,in addition,in return,as a consequence/result等。

         The story about the hen,for my part,seeks to draw our attention to the issue of honesty.

         The public,in conclusion,should do something to relieve the current situation.

      3. 不定式短语作插入语

         to be frank,to tell you the truth,to be honest,to be sure,to make the matter worse等。

         Those charming actors,to be frank,are hard-working when they perform on the stagte.

      4. 分词作插入语

         I believe,I suppose,I'm afraid,What's worse,you know,that is (to say),as far as I know,as far as I'm concerned,believe it or not等。

         Overfishing,believe it or not,has become a widespread problem around the world.

      5. 现在分词作插入语

         常见的短语有：honestly speaking,generally speaking,strictly speaking等，比如：

         The number of fish,strictly speaking,has decreased sharply in ten years.

   3. 应用

      1. 写作

         插入语使语言显得更加正式，所以在一篇作文中，使用3~4次插入语很正常。

      2. 长难句分析

         在阅读理解的长难句中见到插入语，可以忽略或视而不见，但是在翻译中则不可以如此处理。具体的翻译方法视情况而定：

         * 如果插入语表示观点，则要提到句首翻译
         * 如果插入语是修饰前面名词的定语，则按照定语的翻译方法来处理
         * 除了以上两种情况，插入语都可以直接翻译，用小括号隔开即可

         But that,<u>Pearson points out</u>（插入语）,is only the start of man-machine integration（整合，一体化）:"It will be the beginning of the long process of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the next century."

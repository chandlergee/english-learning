1. 什么是定语？

   <u>定语就是修饰名词（短语）的成分，这与中文一致。</u>

2. 定语的成分

   1. 形容词（短语）作定语

      That **kind** nightingale died at last.

      The **extraordinary** rose turns dark red.

   2. 名词（短语）作定语【这时的名词（短语）已经形容词化了】

      The **nightingale's** singing can make the rose bloom.

      The singing **of the nightingale** can make the rose bloom.

      The student falls in love with the **professor's** daughter.

      The student falls in love with the daughter **of the professor**.

      虽然名词（短语）修饰名词（短语）有两种写法，但是英文还是更倾向于写成of结构。

   3. 介词短语作定语

      The nightingale **out of window** heard the sights of the young man.（修饰主语）

      I only have roses **as white as the foam in the sea**.（修饰宾语）

   4. 分词、不定式（非谓语）作定语

      In the end,the **singing** nightingale died because of love.

      The innocent nightingale must have loved the student **deceived** by the girl.

   5. 从句作定语

      The rose **which the nightingale exchanged with her life** failed to help the student.

3. 定语的位置

   定语的位置取决于它的长短，当一个单词修饰名词（短语）时通常放在名词（短语）前面，当两个以上的单词修饰名词（短语）时通常放在名词（短语）后面。但是，注意过去分词作定语，即使是一个单词也放在名词（词组）之后。

   This is a story about a rose and a nightingale.

   At the party of the prince,the youngster understanding romance was rejected.

   The boy dumped（被抛弃的） looks pitiful.

4. 定语从句

   1. 构成

      先行词[名词（短语）] + 引导词 + 分句。

   2. 引导词

      定语从句的引导词按照先行词的种类，一共分为5类：

      * 当先行词是人时，引导词有：that、who、whom、whose。
      * 当先行词是物时，引导词有：that、which、whose。
      * 当先行词是时间时，引导词有：that、which、when。
      * 当先行词是地点时，引导词有：that、which、where。
      * 当先行词是原因时，引导词有：that、which、why。

   3. 举例说明

      He is the man <u>that/who</u> loves me.

      He is the man <u>that/who/whom</u> I love.

      He is the man <u>whose</u> father is wealthy.

      that用作关系代词时，既可以指人，也可以指物，在从句中充当主语或是宾语。

      who用作关系代词时，意思是“….的人，那个….”,“他；她；他们”，一般只用来指人，在从句中可以充当主语或宾语。

      whom用作关系代词时，与who同义，一般只用来指人，在从句中只能充当宾语。

      whose用作关系代词时，意思是“那个人的，那些人的；那一个的；那一些的；”，既可以指人，也可以指物，但只能在从句中充当宾语。

   4. 定语从句的引导词也可以按照引导词本身的词性或按照引导词在从句中充当的成分分为3类：

      1. 代词（在从句中充当主语或宾语的成分）：who、whom（在从句中仅能充当宾语）、that、which。
      2. 副词（在从句中不能充当主干成分）：where、when、why。
      3. 形容词（在从句中只能充当定语成分，修饰名词（短语））：whose。

      The old lady died on that day <u>when</u> her son arrived（不及物动词）.

      The girl prefers the jewelry <u>which/that</u> the prince sent to her.

5. 定语从句的特殊用法

   1. that引导定语从句时，如果在从句中充当宾语，that可以省略。

      I enjoy the movie (that) Zhao Wei directed.

      The potential evolution of today's technology,and its social consequences,is dazzlingly complicated,and it's perhaps best left to science-fiction writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities (that) we can envisage.

      A young man can decide on a likely spouse on his own and then ask his parents to arrange the marriage negotiations,or the young man's parents may take the choice of a spouse,giving the child little to say in the selection,but a girl may veto the spouse (that) her parents have chosen.

   2. 区分限制性定语从句和非限制性定语从句

      1. 限制性定语从句：定语从句紧跟在先行词后，对先行词进行修饰，不能省略，省略后意思不完整。

      2. 非限制性定语从句：对前面的先行词或者整个句子进行补充说明，即使省略也不影响总体意思，用逗号隔开。总结来说，第一，可以省略；第二，起到补充说明作用。

         | 从句及区别点                   | 限制性定语从句               | 非限制性定语从句                               |
         | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
         | 与先行词的关系                 | 关系紧密，删除后影响句子意思 | 关系稀疏，起补充说明作用，删除后不影响主句意思 |
         | 逗号的作用                     | 不用逗号                     | 用逗号                                         |
         | that的作用                     | 可以用that                   | 不可以that                                     |
         | which/whom在从句中作宾语的省略 | 可省略                       | 不可省略                                       |
         | 是否可以修饰句子               | 不可以                       | 可以                                           |
         | 翻译时的区别                   | 常译为定语                   | 常译为单独的句子                               |

      3. 非限制性定语从句的引导词

         非限定性定语从句的引导词不能用that，但选择方法和限定性从句选择引导词是一样的。当先行词时人或物，引导词要用who/whom/whose/which，比如：

         Jane Eyre,whom I have learned a lot from,is a persistent lady. （先行词为人且充当宾语）

         He said he had climbed up the top of the Everest,which I suspect very much.

         My gardener,who is very pessimistic,says that there will be no apples this year.

   3. “介词 + 关系代词”引导的定语从句

      1. 为什么会有“介词 + 关系代词”引导定语从句？

         * 关系副词在定语从句中作状语时，可以用“介词 + 关系代词”替代关系副词

           | 关系副词 | 替换                                | 介词的选择               |
           | -------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
           | when     | 所有介词 + 关系代词                 | 介词根据句子的意思来选择 |
           | where    | 所有介词 + 关系代词                 | 同上                     |
           | why      | 当先行词是reason时，只能用for which | 同上                     |

           This is the city where I have lived for 20 years = This is the city in which I have lived for 20 years.

         * 定语从句的谓语是固定搭配的“动词 + 介词”，并且先行词在从句中作宾语

           This is a subject about which we might argue for a long time.(argue about)

         * 用于表达与上文中的先行词或句子的关系并避免下文与上文的重复。

           Playing basketball is a beneficial exercise from which we can obtain many advantages.

      2. “介词 + 关系代词”中代词的选择

         * 修饰人时，只能用whom

           He is the student with whom my teacher talked.

         * 修饰物时，只能用which

           This is the hotel at which Mr Jason likes to stay.

         * whose可以用of which/whom替换

           Mr Liu criticized the students whose/of whom homework hasn't been handed in.

           We live in a house whose/of which windows open to the south.
      
   4. 固定搭配the same … as 和 the same … that引导的定语从句

      the same … as 表示所引导的定语从句的从句内容与先行词同类而不同物，翻译成“像……一样的”；the same … that表示所引导的从句内容与先行词同类且同物，即同一事物，翻译成“正是……”。

      Mr Darcy is the same man as I love.我喜欢的是像达西先生一样的男人。

      Mr Darcy is the same man that I love.我爱的男人正是达西先生。

   5. as 和which引导的非限定性定语从句

      1. 相同点：两者都可以引导非限定性定语从句

      2. 不同点

         * as引导的非限定性定语从句，位置随便放（as引导的从句可位于主句前、中、后），翻译成“正如”；which只能放在修饰的句子的后面，如：

           As we all know,man struggles upwards and water flows downwards.

           Man struggles upwards and water flows downwards,which is known to us all.

         * 紧跟as后的动词是be动词，而which后可以是任何类型的动词：、

           As is known to the United States,Mark Twain is a great writer.

           He changed his mind,which made me very angry.

   6. 定语从句中引导词which和that的区别

      两者都可以指物，常可互换，主要区别在于：

      1. 使用which的情况

         * 引导非限制性定语从句

           The current,which is very rapid,makes the river dangerous.

           The London team,which played so well last season,has done badly this season.

         * 放在介词后作宾语时用which

           The document for which they were searching have been recovered.

           He had only the long nights in which he could study.

      2. 用that的情况

         * 当先行词是不定代词much，little，none，all，few，every(thing)，any(thing)，no(thing)等

           I did nothing that might hurt you.

           The sleeping man's subconscious mind retained everything that was said around him.

         * 当主句以here，there开头时

           Here is the hotel that you've been looking for.

           There is a room in the building that is still free.

         * 当先行词被the only，the same，the very等限定词修饰时

           When people talk about ChongQing,the first that comes to mind is the Hotpot.

           This is the only film that has been shown in our school this term.

         * 当先行词被any，few，little，no，all，much，some等词修饰时

           You can take any seat that is free.

           There is little work that fits for you.

         * 当先行词被序数词或形容词最高级修饰

           This is the most interesting story book that I have ever read.

           The first thing that people usually notice about Jill Abramson is her voice.

         * 当先行词是疑问代词who，which，what或主句以这些词开头

           Who that has ever worked together with him doesn't admire him?

           Which is the star that is nearer to the earth?

         * 当先行词既有人又有物时

           She likes taking photos of those people and things that she is interested in.

           They are talking of the heroines and their deeds that interest them.

6. 区分定语从句和同位语从句

   I had a dream that was definitely sweet.（定语从句）

   I had a dream that I would become a rich lady someday.（同位语从句）

   区别：

   1. 首先看引导词that，定语从句的引导词that在从句中充当主语或宾语，而同位语从句的that在从句中不作任何成分，也没有任何意思。
   2. 看句子含义，定语从句是对前面名词的修饰，而同位语从句是对前面名词的解释。
   3. 看先行词，定语从句的先行词可以是任何名词，而同位语从句的先行词只能是可以解释的名词——抽象名词。
   4. 定语从句的引导词有很多，而同位语从句的引导词<u>通常</u>是that（因为同位语从句大部分是陈述句）
